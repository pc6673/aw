	The above error could possibly be related to other connected instances. Following is a list of 
	all the related clock rules and their respective instances.

	Clock Rule: rule_iotile_bufr
	Status: PASS
	Rule Description: An IO driving a BUFR must both be placed in the same clock region
	trimac_fifo_block/trimac_sup_block/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_i/U0/gmii_interface/gmii_rx_clk_ibuf_i (IBUF.O) is locked to U14
	trimac_fifo_block/trimac_sup_block/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_i/U0/gmii_interface/bufr_gmii_rx_clk (BUFR.I) cannot be placed

	Clock Rule: rule_bufh_bufr_ramb
	Status: PASS
	Rule Description: Reginal buffers in the same clock region must drive a total number of brams less
	than the capacity of the region
	trimac_fifo_block/trimac_sup_block/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_i/U0/gmii_interface/bufr_gmii_rx_clk (BUFR.O) cannot be placed

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
2 out of 15 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: clk_in_n, clk_in_p.

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	trimac_fifo_block/trimac_sup_block/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_i/U0/clock_inst/mii_tx_clk_ibuf_i (IBUF.O) is locked to H18
	trimac_fifo_block/trimac_sup_block/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_i/U0/clock_inst/BUFGMUX_SPEED_CLK (BUFGCTRL.I1) cannot be placed

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 trimac_fifo_block/user_side_FIFO/rx_fifo_i/rx_ramgen_i/mem_reg has an input control pin trimac_fifo_block/user_side_FIFO/rx_fifo_i/rx_ramgen_i/mem_reg/ENARDEN (net: trimac_fifo_block/user_side_FIFO/rx_fifo_i/rx_ramgen_i/reset_out) which is driven by a register (trimac_fifo_block/rx_mac_reset_gen/reset_sync4) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
