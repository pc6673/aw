2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_pl_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-344#1 Warning
Design_needs_USER_RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY_set  
The design property USER_RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY on the top-level current_design object is unset (or set to -1).  The estimated RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY used for the design is 0 and assumes a worst-case switching scenario for the URAM and BRAM.  RAM activity directly impacts clock uncertainty and the RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY property may not be accurate for designs that are not final.  It is recommended that the USER_RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY property be specified.  Please refer to the Versal ACAP Clocking Resources Architecture Manual and the Versal ACAP Hardware, IP, and Platform Development Methodology User Guide for more information on specifying the USER_RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-72#1 Advisory
Substitute PLL for MMCME5 check  
The MMCME5 cell design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clock_primitive_inst/MMCME5_inst has a single input clock whose source driver, UNKNOWN, is not optimally located and the MMCM has a configuration which could be accommodated by a PLL.  Consider changing the MMCM to a PLL which could align better with the input clock driver.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-75#1 Advisory
MMCME5 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME5 cell design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clock_primitive_inst/MMCME5_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) design_1_wrapper_i/design_1_i/versal_cips_0/inst/pspmc_0/inst/buffer_pl_clk_0.PL_CLK_0_BUFG and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
Related violations: <none>
