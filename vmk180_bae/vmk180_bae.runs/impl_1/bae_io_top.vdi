It is suggested to confirm via unisim simulation with SIM_COLLISION_CHECK != NONE that an address collision never occurs and if so try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design.
